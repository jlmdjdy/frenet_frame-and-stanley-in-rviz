# optimal frenet path and stanley control


### (given global map and global path to be tracked)


1. find possible candidate paths selected under constraint conditions. (max accelrations, max velocity, max curvature, collisions with obstacles) - cand_paths

2. find optimal paths among cand_paths, which has lowest cost among costs of cand_paths, taking several performance factors such as consistency of path, jerk, time lapsed, target velocity and global path tracking performance into account.

3. get actuation values

    - get acceleration with pid control to get to the target speed given difference to target speed(for p), difference to previous velocity(for d) and accumulated difference to target speed(for i) - longitudinal control

    - get steering angle with stanley control given x, y, s points of the optimal path to be tracked and currnet x, y, yaw, v(speed) - lateral control
